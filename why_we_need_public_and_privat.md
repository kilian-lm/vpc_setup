# Why We Need Private and Public Environments per Cloud Provider

Establishing both private and public environments within each cloud provider is a fundamental practice in designing
secure, scalable, and efficient cloud architectures.

Here's why:

# Security Enhancement

Isolation of Resources:

## Private Subnets:

By placing sensitive resources (like databases, notebooks, and processing clusters) in private subnets, we ensure they
are not directly exposed to the internet. This isolation reduces the attack surface and protects against unauthorized
access.
Public Subnets: Resources that need to be accessible from the internet (like load balancers and bastion hosts) are
placed in public subnets with controlled access.
Controlled Access Points:

Public subnets act as entry points to the network. By funneling all external traffic through specific, secured
services (like load balancers), we can apply consistent security policies and monitoring.
Defense in Depth:

Layered security controls can be applied differently in public and private environments, enhancing overall security. For
example, Network Access Control Lists (NACLs) and security groups can be tailored to the specific needs of each
environment.

# Compliance and Regulatory Requirements

## Data Protection:

Certain regulations require that sensitive data be stored and processed in environments not directly accessible from the
internet. Private subnets help in complying with standards like GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS.
Audit and Monitoring:

Segregated environments make it easier to monitor access and maintain logs, which are essential for compliance audits.

# Network Performance and Efficiency

## Optimized Traffic Flow:

Internal traffic between private resources doesn't need to traverse the internet, reducing latency and bandwidth costs.
Scalability:

Private environments can be scaled independently of public-facing services, allowing for more efficient resource
utilization.

# Cost Management

## Avoiding Unnecessary Charges:

Data transfer within the same VPC or region is often cheaper than transferring data over the internet. By keeping
internal communications within private subnets, we can reduce costs.
Resource Allocation:

Allocating resources appropriately between public and private environments helps in optimizing spending based on the
required performance and accessibility.

# Simplified Management and Maintenance

## Organizational Clarity:

Separating resources into public and private environments makes it easier for teams to manage and maintain them. It
clarifies which resources are internet-facing and which are internal.
Automated Deployments:

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools can be used more effectively when environments are well-defined, enabling automated
deployments and updates.

# Enhanced User Experience for Data Scientists and Programmers

## Secure Access to Tools:

Data scientists and programmers often need access to sensitive tools and data. Hosting these resources in private
subnets ensures they can work securely without exposing critical assets.
Streamlined Onboarding:

With private environments, onboarding processes can include secure access setups (like VPNs or bastion hosts), ensuring
new users have the necessary permissions without compromising security.

# Flexibility and Future-Proofing

## Hybrid and Multi-Cloud Strategies:

Having consistent private and public environments across cloud providers facilitates easier integration and potential
migration between platforms.
VPC Peering and Connectivity:

Private subnets allow for secure connections between different VPCs or on-premises networks, enabling scalable
architectures that can grow with organizational needs.
