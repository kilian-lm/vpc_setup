Sure! Below is a sophisticated Mermaid diagram (`.mmd` format) that illustrates a robust architecture for deploying
resources into one or two Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) across AWS and GCP platforms. The architecture emphasizes
seamless deployment of notebooks, Dataproc clusters, virtual machines (VMs), and other resources, all within the VPCs.
It also showcases an automated Identity and Access Management (IAM) system for efficient onboarding and authentication
of new data scientists and programmers.

**Explanation of the Architecture:**

1. **VPC Structure for AWS and GCP:**
    - **AWS Cloud:**
        - **VPC_AWS** contains both public and private subnets.
        - **Public Subnet:** Hosts the **Internet Gateway**, **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)**, and **EC2 Instances**.
        - **Private Subnet:** Contains **Amazon SageMaker Notebooks** and **RDS Databases**.
        - **EC2 Instances** in the public subnet can access resources in the private subnet.

    - **GCP Cloud:**
        - **VPC_GCP** also consists of public and private subnets.
        - **Public Subnet:** Includes the **Internet Gateway**, **Cloud Load Balancer**, and **Compute Engine VMs**.
        - **Private Subnet:** Houses **Dataproc Clusters** and **Cloud SQL Databases**.
        - **Compute Engine VMs** can access private resources like Dataproc clusters and Cloud SQL databases.

2. **Resource Deployment:**
    - All resources (notebooks, Dataproc clusters, VMs, databases) are deployed within their respective VPCs.
    - Resources are segmented into public and private subnets for security and scalability.
    - Load balancers in the public subnets manage incoming traffic and distribute it to the appropriate resources.

3. **Identity and Access Management (IAM):**
    - **Centralized Identity Provider (IdP)/SSO:** Acts as a single source of truth for user identities.
    - **New Users** are onboarded automatically through the IdP, which could be a system like **Okta**, **Azure AD**, or
      any SAML/OIDC-compliant provider.
    - The IdP federates access to both **IAM_AWS** and **IAM_GCP**, streamlining authentication and authorization
      processes.
    - **IAM Roles & Policies** in both AWS and GCP are configured to trust the IdP, allowing for seamless user
      provisioning and access control.

4. **Automated Onboarding and Authentication:**
    - New data scientists and programmers are added to the IdP, which automatically provisions their access to resources
      in AWS and GCP.
    - Role-based access control (RBAC) ensures users have the necessary permissions without manual intervention.
    - Policies are centrally managed, reducing the risk of misconfigurations and enhancing security compliance.

5. **Optional VPC Peering:**
    - **VPC Peering** between AWS and GCP VPCs enables direct network traffic between resources in both clouds.
    - This setup is optional and can be configured based on specific cross-cloud communication requirements.

6. **Security and Best Practices:**
    - Separation of public and private subnets enhances security by isolating resources that do not require direct
      internet access.
    - Use of IAM roles and policies enforces the principle of least privilege.
    - Centralized identity management reduces administrative overhead and improves compliance with security standards.

**Expert Considerations:**

- **Scalability:** The architecture supports horizontal scaling by adding more instances or resources within the
  subnets.
- **High Availability:** Deploying resources across multiple availability zones (not depicted) can further enhance
  resilience.
- **Cost Efficiency:** Utilizing reserved instances and optimizing resource utilization can reduce operational costs.
- **Compliance:** Adhering to industry standards like **ISO 27001**, **HIPAA**, or **GDPR** is facilitated through
  centralized policies.

**Implementation Notes:**

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Use tools like **Terraform** or **CloudFormation** to codify and automate the
  deployment of this architecture.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** Implement pipelines to automate the deployment and updates
  of resources.
- **Monitoring and Logging:** Integrate with services like **AWS CloudWatch**, **GCP Cloud Monitoring**, or third-party
  solutions for observability.
